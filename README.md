# Complex sequences.

## Introduction
Represent and draw complex sequences, creating beautiful fractals.

There are different types:
- parametric fractals, like the Mandelbrot's,
- seed-fractals, like Julia's or Newton's.

## GUI.
Using `imgui`:
- drawing each pixel of the sequence,
- settings windows.
