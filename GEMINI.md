# Gemini Code Assistant Report

## Project Overview

This project, `complex_sequences`, is a Rust application designed to visualize complex number sequences and generate fractals. It is set up to explore mathematical concepts like Mandelbrot, Julia, and Newton fractals, rendering them graphically.

The application leverages the following key technologies:

- **Rust:** The core programming language.
- **`imgui`:** A popular immediate mode GUI library used to create the user interface and settings windows. These are Rust bindings from the original C++ `imgui` library. 
- **`glium`:** An OpenGL wrapper for Rust, used as the rendering backend for `imgui`.
- **`winit`:** A window creation and management library.

The project structure is organized with a main application entry point that initializes a GUI, and a `support` module that encapsulates the boilerplate code for setting up and running the `imgui`-based interface.

## Building and Running the Project.

To build and run this project, you will need to have the Rust toolchain installed.

**Build the project:**
```bash
cargo build
```

**Verify code, look for compiler error:**
```bash
cargo check
```

**Run the application:**
```bash
cargo run
```

**Run tests:**
There are no tests in the project yet. To run tests, use the command:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Development Conventions.

- **GUI:** The project uses `imgui` for its user interface. UI components and logic should be implemented within the `run_ui` closure passed to the `simple_init` or `init_with_startup` functions in the `support` module. The `support` directory is directly cloned from the `imgui_examples` [Github repository](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-examples).
- **GUI Sources:** 
	- [Imgui C++ repository](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/);
	- [Imgui Rust repository](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-rs);
	- [Imgui Rust official examples](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-examples);
- **Dependencies:** Project dependencies are managed using `Cargo.toml`.
- **Modules:** The code is organized into modules. The `support` module contains generic GUI setup code, which is a good practice to separate the application logic from the UI boilerplate.
- **Error Handling:** The project uses `expect` for error handling in the GUI setup, which is common for examples but should be replaced with more robust error handling for a production application. From now, new code will use `Result`.
- **Code generation:** Rules:
	- Always extensively document functions, `struct`s, `enum`s, `trait`s, `type`s, `const`s. 
	- When code is generated by Gemini AI, it must prefix by a comment containing `**(AI) - Code generated by Gemini CLI.**`.
	- Each Rust file must start with a documentation header (using //!). It must contains the project name, and the file location, relative to the project root. Uses markdown. Example: 
	```
	//! # Complex sequences.
	//! src/support/clipboard.rs  
	``` 

## Current Objective: Imgui Learning Path
- **Goal:** Create a step-by-step lesson plan to teach the user how to use `imgui-rs` to build a fractal renderer (pixel-by-pixel updates) with a custom settings interface.
- **Location:** All lesson materials (markdown files, code snippets, etc.) must be stored in `resources/imgui-learning/`.
- **Outcome:** A functional application capable of rendering complex sequence fractals with a polished UI.

## AI Conventions.
- If stuck: don't hallucinate, say `I'm stuck on [PUT THE SITUATION HERE], because [PUT THE PROBLEM HERE]`.
- Do not modify the dependencies, nor their versions:
	- If it is an absolute necessity: explicit why, and verify its compatibility with the other dependencies.
